                <h2>Volunteers</h2>
                <p id="v1" className={styles.questionheader}>How do I sign up as a volunteer?</p>
                <p>Navigate to the <a href="/register" target="_blank">sign up</a> page and fill out all the necessary information. Including your location, skills, and interests will help you find more relevant events to volunteer for</p>
                <p id="v2" className={styles.questionheader}>How do I view my profile?</p>
                <p>Once you sign up and log in <a href="/login" target="_blank">here</a>, the top menu will include a link to your profile.</p>
                <p id="v3" className={styles.questionheader}>How do I edit my profile?</p>
                <p>On the left-hand side of your profile is an “About me” box. There, click the “Edit Profile” button to change the details!</p>
                <p id="v4" className={styles.questionheader}>How can I search for and sign up for events?</p>
                <p>You can search for events both from the <a href="/index" target="_blank"> home page</a> and the <a href="/search" target="_blank">search page</a>. Just choose your preferred category and neighborhood, press the search button, and the results will appear on screen.</p>
                <p id="v5" className={styles.questionheader}>How do I view my events?</p>
                <p>Your profile page has two sections in the middle containing events you’ve completed (past events), and upcoming events that you’ve signed up for.</p>
                <p id="v6" className={styles.questionheader}>How do I log my hours volunteered?</p>
                <p>In the “Past Events” section in your profile, in the top right of each event box is a “log hours” button. Clicking on that button reveals a popup where you can enter the hours which you worked at the event.</p>
                <p id="v7" className={styles.questionheader}>How do I view the hours I have volunteered?</p>
                <p>On the right hand side of your profile are a few charts, and a button that says “More details”. Clicking on that button will bring you to the hours page, which has both the charts, and a more detailed filter system. This allows you to view hours you’ve volunteered per organization, with neighborhood, date, skills, and interest filters.</p>
                <p id="v8" className={styles.questionheader}>Can organizations search for me?</p>
                <p>Of course not! An organization can only view limited details about a user if they signed up for an upcoming event, and that’s it.</p>

                <p id="o2" className={styles.questionheader}>How do I edit an organization profile?</p>
